# File_Integrity_Manager_Using_Python
Cyber Security Mini Project using Python( Integrity Based)
Hello Everyone This is a Project of CyberSecurity which is an integrity based project which is one of the most important term of Cyber Security i.e. CIA(Confidentiality, Integrity & Authenticity) Triad

This Project is coded in Python which can be Implemented over a Single File and it just look at the file and captures the hashes (in sha 512 encryption) of the file and then monitors it by continously checking the hashes of the Target File

as soon as any of the file gets any changes according to calculation made using hashes it will be giving alerts to the user alerts could be as follows:

<FILE_NAME> IS CHANGED

<FILE_NAME> IS DELETED

<FILE_NAME> HAS BEEN REMOVED

when you will run the file you will get a file name as FIM.py which is the main file so ou can just open it in your suitable IDE or environment and run it normally as a python file

it will be asking you for the path of the file and then just hit enter after entring the path and it will be capturing the baseline or hashes and then start monitoring the file

so it can be monitored and it will let you know about the file changes happened or not

Enjoy Your FIM(File Integrity Manager)
